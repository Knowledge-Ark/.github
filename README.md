### Problem
While information is available at our fingertips through Google Search, Chat GPT, etc., our learning is limited to the questions we ask. When we want to learn something new, it’s left to us, the individual, to find and organize the scattered information from across different websites, books, courses and more. This is a pain you, me and every avid learner has to endure. This is an imperceptible challenge that we take for granted and live with.

### Solution
What if there is a place where you could get a *holistic understanding* of the subject you want to learn? What if it could show you all the topics and sub-topics in the subject with a brief description? What if it could show you how the topics are connected within and across subjects?
What if it could direct you to the right sources in case you want to deep-dive into any of the topics?

*Knowledge Ark* is a *website* that intends to do exactly that. In a nutshell, Knowledge Ark presents subject-wise information in an organized and structured manner to make knowledge more accessible. To help you conceptualize, Knowledge Ark is something similar to [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/corporate-finance-and-accounting-4689821) and [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) but much more. 

**Vision**
Knowledge Ark will be *the next Wikipedia***.** It will be the go-to place for anyone to learn something new and expand their knowledge of a subject. It aims to organize information on a wide array of subjects including business, tech, social science, personal development and more. It’ll give you a holistic view of subjects and know-how topics of different subjects are interconnected.

**Why the name ‘Knowledge Ark’**
The word ‘Knowledge Ark’ means doomsday vault where a collection of knowledge is preserved in such a way that future generations would have access if all other copies of it were lost due to a mass destruction event. ([Knowledge ark - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_ark)). The thought behind naming this project ‘Knowledge Ark’ is that - why not give better access to knowledge and build a better world while we are still alive!?
